# JPP 1.3b — Judgment Premised Processing
*A Thomistic Operating System for Disciplined, Altitude‑Aware Action*

**Author:** Dominic G. Flamiano, OP, JD  
**Version:** 1.3b (Frozen Trunk)

## What Is JPP?
**JPP 1.3b** is a five‑phase discipline for human judgment under pressure:

**Frame → Receive & Sense → Orient & Align → Act Vector → Iterate**

It integrates a **Judgment Gyroscope** (steadiness), an **Ethical Engine** (sequenced moves), the **Cardinal/Theological virtue axes** (proportion + orientation), and **Wu‑Wei timing** (disciplined non‑action). The result is **proportionate, altitude‑aware action** that reduces noise, prevents overreaction, and compresses ethically when time is short.

> One sentence: *a human discipline that makes decisions cleaner—fast when needed, restrained when right.*

## Stewardship Notice
**JPP 1.3b is a discipline for human judgment, not a substitute for it.** Proper use presumes formation in ethics, authority, and consequence. Misapplication—especially as a control device, a speed hack, or a proxy for conscience—is outside scope and contrary to design. Use requires attribution and respect for the model’s limits; derivative methods must disclose divergence from JPP 1.3b.

## Red‑Line Misuses
- No “Act Vector” without “Orient & Align.”  
- No use of “altitude” to bypass accountable stakeholders.  
- No reordering/renaming phases in works claiming JPP.  
- No “JPP‑compliant” claims for AI‑only/automated workflows.  
- No training others unless operator readiness is met.

## Changelog
- **1.3b (Frozen Trunk):** Canonical release.
